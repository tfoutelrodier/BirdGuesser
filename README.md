## Origin

Several familly members were learning bird songs and I though it would be a nice project to try and make something for them.
Similar games exists and can be found on the interner but this one I can customize how I want. 

I also wanted to learn how to make simple webapps. I knew python and the bases of HTML and CSS so I decided to try my hand at Flask for this project.
