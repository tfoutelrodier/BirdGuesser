# BirdGuesser

## Game principle
An educational game about learning bird songs.

You can also train by listening to specific birds

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/tfoutelrodier/BirdGuesser
python BirdGuesser/flaskr/app.py
```

## Origin

Several familly members were learning bird songs and I though it would be a nice project to try and make something for them.
I also wanted to learn how to make simple webapps. I knew python and the bases of HTML and CSS so I decided to try my hand at Flask for this project. 

Similar games exists and can be found on the internert but this one I can customize how I want. It is still a work in progress
